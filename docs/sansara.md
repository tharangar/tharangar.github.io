## Samsara and Nirwana

According to the concept of samsara, individuals are bound to this cycle of existence and undergo repeated cycles of birth, life, death, and subsequent rebirth. The specific circumstances of each rebirth are determined by the accumulated actions, known as karma, from previous lives.

Samsara is often characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, and the perpetual cycle of desire and attachment. The ultimate goal for many spiritual traditions is to break free from this cycle and attain liberation or enlightenment, which is considered a state of liberation from suffering and the end of the cycle of samsara.

In Buddhism, for example, achieving liberation from samsara is sought through the realization of the Four Noble Truths and following the Noble Eightfold Path. By eliminating ignorance, craving, and attachment, individuals can attain enlightenment (nirvana) and escape the cycle of samsara.

In Hinduism, samsara is viewed as part of a broader belief system that includes concepts like dharma (righteousness), karma (actions and their consequences), and moksha (liberation from samsara). Hinduism teaches that the soul, known as Atman, is eternal and transmigrates from one body to another in samsara until it achieves moksha, union with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

While the specific interpretations and details of samsara may vary across different traditions, the central idea remains consistent: the cyclical process of birth, death, and rebirth experienced by sentient beings, driven by karma and the desire for fulfillment and liberation from suffering.
