# Existance of Life according to Buddhism

According to the concept of samsara, individuals are bound to this cycle of existence and undergo repeated cycles of birth, life, death, and subsequent rebirth. The specific circumstances of each rebirth are determined by the accumulated actions, known as karma, from previous lives.

Samsara is often characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, and the perpetual cycle of desire and attachment. The ultimate goal for many spiritual traditions is to break free from this cycle and attain liberation or enlightenment, which is considered a state of liberation from suffering and the end of the cycle of samsara.

In Buddhism, for example, achieving liberation from samsara is sought through the realization of the Four Noble Truths and following the Noble Eightfold Path. By eliminating ignorance, craving, and attachment, individuals can attain enlightenment (nirvana) and escape the cycle of samsara.

# Four Norbal Truths

Statements that cannot be false forever are referred to as "necessarily true" statements or "eternally true" statements. These are statements that are true in all possible circumstances or conditions and cannot be false under any circumstances.

There are four eternally trues that exists which are called four norbal truths and main target of the buddhism is realize these four thruths and he who realized these 4 truths completely is the one who achived Nirvan (enlightment).
So the person wanted to realize it he has to start his journey with simple understanding these truth and with the belief of Buddhas words and he has to go in the path step by step as Buddha has prescribed and person who follows will realize each of these truths instead of simple understanding of them.

In Buddhism, there are four fundamental truths known as the Four Noble Truths. These truths form the core teachings of Buddhism and provide insights into the nature of suffering and the path to liberation. Here are the Four Noble Truths:

1. The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha): The first truth acknowledges the existence of suffering or dissatisfaction (dukkha) in life. It recognizes that all beings experience various forms of suffering, including physical and mental pain, loss, aging, illness, and the general unsatisfactoriness of existence.
2. The Truth of the Cause of Suffering (Samudaya): The second truth explores the origins or causes of suffering. It states that the root cause of suffering is craving (tanha) and attachment. By desiring things, clinging to them, and having unrealistic expectations, we create suffering for ourselves and others.
3. The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Nirodha): The third truth reveals that there is a possibility to end suffering. It emphasizes that by eliminating craving and attachment, we can attain a state of liberation, peace, and freedom from suffering known as Nirvana.
4. The Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering (Magga): The fourth truth outlines the path or the way to end suffering. It presents the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of eight interconnected practices: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Following this path leads to the cessation of suffering and the realization of Nirvana.

5. These Four Noble Truths serve as a foundational framework for understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation in Buddhism

Then each 4 norbal truth further described.
Sarrow descibe as follows.
Sankiththena pancha updanas kanda dukka.

Panchaupadanskanda.

[Panchaupdanskanda (dukka in summary)](./docs/panchaupadanskanda.md).

 The term "pancha upadana skandha" refers to the "Five Aggregates of Clinging" or "Five Clinging Aggregates" in Buddhism. These aggregates are fundamental components of human experience that together constitute what we conventionally refer to as a "self" or "individual." They are central to the Buddha's teachings on the nature of existence and the causes of suffering.

The Five Aggregates are:

*    Rupa (Form): This aggregate refers to the physical aspects of experience, including the body and the physical world. It encompasses all sensory experiences related to form, such as sight, sound, taste, touch, smell and thoughts.

*    Vedana (Feeling): Vedana refers to the various feelings or sensations that arise from contact with the sensory world. These feelings can be pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.

*    Sanna (Perception): Sanna involves the process of recognizing and labeling objects based on past experiences. It is the mental factor responsible for recognizing and giving meaning to sensory input.

*    Sankhara (Mental Formations): Sankhara encompasses all mental activities, including thoughts, emotions, volitions, and intentions. It includes both conscious and unconscious mental processes.

*    Vinnana (Consciousness): Vinnana is the awareness or consciousness that arises from the interaction between the sensory organs and their respective objects. It is the cognitive process that allows us to be aware of our experiences.


According to Buddhist teachings, these Five Aggregates are impermanent, constantly changing, and lacking a permanent, independent self. The attachment or clinging to these aggregates as if they are a fixed and enduring "self" is considered one of the primary causes of suffering (dukkha) in life. Understanding the nature of these aggregates and their impermanence is essential for cultivating insight and ultimately achieving liberation from suffering.

The doctrine of the Five Aggregates is a core component of the Buddha's teaching on the nature of reality and forms the basis for understanding the concept of "anatta" or "anatman," which means "not-self" or "no-self."




Couases for the Sarrow is identified as Patichchasamuppdaya in budhism.
## Patichchasamuppada

> Patichchasamuppadaya is the way buddism describe the all living being existance.
>
> Someone who reqlized the patichchasamuppadaya is said to be who attained Nirwana.

In Buddhism, "paṭiccasamuppāda" (Pali) or "pratītyasamutpāda" (Sanskrit) refers to the concept of dependent origination or dependent arising. It is one of the key teachings of the Buddha and is often described as the process of causality or interconnectedness of phenomena.

According to the teaching of paṭiccasamuppāda, all things and experiences arise dependent on multiple causes and conditions. It explains how suffering (dukkha) arises and how it can be overcome by understanding and breaking the chain of causation.

The teaching of paṭiccasamuppāda is typically represented by a twelve-link chain of causation, known as the "Twelve Nidanas." These links describe the causal process that leads to the cycle of birth, aging, sickness, and death (samsara). The Twelve Nidanas are as follows:


   1. Avijja (Lack of the knowledge of our existance mechanism)
   2. Sanskhara (Attachment and dis attachment in mind for what we see as world.)
   3. Vinyana (Energy form of mind)
   4. Nama/Rupa ( Rupa is our body and Nama is the mind )
   5. Salayatana (the six sense (eye, ears, nose, toung , body, mind))
   6. Phassa (Signals from each sense bases.)
   7. Vedana (feeling created by signals from each sense.)
   8. Tanha (Attachment for defferent vedana)
   9. Upadana (Karmic energy induced by Tanha)
   10. Bhava (Karmic energy create future life existance in Sansara )
   11. Jati (Becouse Bhava being created once died in this life time next birth is to be happened.)
   12. Jara-marana (aging and death becouse of birth in some where as human, thirisan, pretha, gods, brahma or hell)

Each one is a producte of the previous couase.

![Patichchasamuppadaya image](https://github.com/tharangar/tharangar.github.io/blob/master/docs/images/patichchasamuppada.png)
This chain of causation explains that ignorance (avijja) is the root cause of suffering, and by breaking the chain at the level of ignorance, one can attain liberation (nibbana) from the cycle of samsara.

The teaching of paṭiccasamuppāda is considered fundamental in understanding the nature of reality and the interdependent nature of all phenomena. It highlights the importance of recognizing the impermanence and insubstantiality of all conditioned things and the need to cultivate wisdom and insight to transcend suffering.

### Sansara

According to budism above chain is repeating eternally. Buddha has vitnessed  that any one can't see the start and end end of sansara. 
So it  is that much longer  we  think, The only way to hack the sansara and exit from your existance.
According  to buddhism our existence is in this  life is just a one  bhava and it will be repeated forever untill we can exit from the sansara.


The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Nirodha) is described as Nirwana.
### Nirwana

Nirwana is the hightest that can be achived as a living being. But it is not an physically existing place.
Nirwana is just you cancelling your eternal existance called Sansara.



The Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering (Magga).
The last truth shows the path to Nirwana or distruction of the existnace by eightfold path.
### Eightfold path.

The Noble Eightfold Path is a central teaching in Buddhism and is considered the path to the cessation of suffering and the realization of enlightenment. It consists of eight interconnected practices or steps that guide individuals towards liberation. Here are the components of the Noble Eightfold Path:

1. Right Understanding (Samma Ditthi): Developing a correct understanding of the nature of reality, including the Four Noble Truths, the law of cause and effect (karma), and the impermanence of all phenomena.
2. Right Intention (Samma Sankappa): Cultivating wholesome intentions and attitudes, such as renunciation, goodwill, and compassion, while letting go of harmful thoughts or desires.
3. Right Speech (Samma Vaca): Engaging in truthful, kind, and beneficial speech, avoiding lying, divisive speech, harsh language, and idle gossip.
4. Right Action (Samma Kammanta): Acting in ways that are ethical and non-harming, abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
5. Right Livelihood (Samma Ajiva): Choosing a livelihood that is honorable, honest, and does not cause harm to oneself or others. This involves avoiding occupations related to weapons, intoxicants, and other harmful activities.
6. Right Effort (Samma Vayama): Making a diligent and sustained effort to cultivate wholesome qualities, abandon unwholesome states, and maintain a balanced state of mind.
7. Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati): Developing mindful awareness of one's body, feelings, mind, and phenomena in the present moment. It involves observing experiences without attachment or aversion.
8. Right Concentration (Samma Samadhi): Cultivating focused and concentrated states of mind through meditation practices. This includes developing deep levels of concentration and insight, leading to a unified and tranquil state of mind.

The Noble Eightfold Path is an integrated system, and each component supports and reinforces the others. By following this path, individuals gradually cultivate wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline, leading to the ultimate goal of liberation from suffering and the realization of enlightenment.

The First step is Samma Ditti which is right understnading.
