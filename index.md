# Existance of Life according to Buddhism

According to the concept of samsara, individuals are bound to this cycle of existence and undergo repeated cycles of birth, life, death, and subsequent rebirth. The specific circumstances of each rebirth are determined by the accumulated actions, known as karma, from previous lives.

Samsara is often characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, and the perpetual cycle of desire and attachment. The ultimate goal for many spiritual traditions is to break free from this cycle and attain liberation or enlightenment, which is considered a state of liberation from suffering and the end of the cycle of samsara.

In Buddhism, for example, achieving liberation from samsara is sought through the realization of the Four Noble Truths and following the Noble Eightfold Path. By eliminating ignorance, craving, and attachment, individuals can attain enlightenment (nirvana) and escape the cycle of samsara.

# Four Norbal Truths

Statements that cannot be false forever are referred to as "necessarily true" statements or "eternally true" statements. These are statements that are true in all possible circumstances or conditions and cannot be false under any circumstances.

There are four eternally trues that exists which are called four norbal truths and main target of the buddhism is realize these four thruths and he who realized these 4 truths completely is the one who achived Nirvan (enlightment).
So the person wanted to realize it he has to start his journey with simple understanding these truth and with the belief of Buddhas words and he has to go in the path step by step as Buddha has prescribed and person who follows will realize each of these truths instead of simple understanding of them.

In Buddhism, "paṭiccasamuppāda" (Pali) or "pratītyasamutpāda" (Sanskrit) refers to the concept of dependent origination or dependent arising. It is one of the key teachings of the Buddha and is often described as the process of causality or interconnectedness of phenomena.

According to the teaching of paṭiccasamuppāda, all things and experiences arise dependent on multiple causes and conditions. It explains how suffering (dukkha) arises and how it can be overcome by understanding and breaking the chain of causation.

The teaching of paṭiccasamuppāda is typically represented by a twelve-link chain of causation, known as the "Twelve Nidanas." These links describe the causal process that leads to the cycle of birth, aging, sickness, and death (samsara). The Twelve Nidanas are as follows:

    Avijja (Lack of the knowledge of our existance mechanism)
    Sanskhara (Attachment and dis attachment in mind for what we see as world.)
    Vinyana (Energy form of mind)
    Namarupa (eye, ears, nose, toung , body, mind)
    Salayatana (the six sense bases from above mentioned Namarupa)
    Phassa (Signals from each sense bases.)
    Vedana (feeling created by signals from each sense.)
    Tanha (Attachment for defferent vedana)
    Upadana (Karmic energy induced by Tanha)
    Bhava (Karmic energy create future life existance in Sansara )
    Jati (Becouse Bhava being created once died in this life time next birth is to be happened.)
    Jara-marana (aging and death becouse of birth in some where as human, thirisan, pretha, gods, brahma or hell)

This chain of causation explains that ignorance (avijja) is the root cause of suffering, and by breaking the chain at the level of ignorance, one can attain liberation (nibbana) from the cycle of samsara.

The teaching of paṭiccasamuppāda is considered fundamental in understanding the nature of reality and the interdependent nature of all phenomena. It highlights the importance of recognizing the impermanence and insubstantiality of all conditioned things and the need to cultivate wisdom and insight to transcend suffering.
