# Existance of Life according to Buddhism

According to the concept of samsara, individuals are bound to this cycle of existence and undergo repeated cycles of birth, life, death, and subsequent rebirth. The specific circumstances of each rebirth are determined by the accumulated actions, known as karma, from previous lives.

Samsara is often characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, and the perpetual cycle of desire and attachment. The ultimate goal for many spiritual traditions is to break free from this cycle and attain liberation or enlightenment, which is considered a state of liberation from suffering and the end of the cycle of samsara.

In Buddhism, for example, achieving liberation from samsara is sought through the realization of the Four Noble Truths and following the Noble Eightfold Path. By eliminating ignorance, craving, and attachment, individuals can attain enlightenment (nirvana) and escape the cycle of samsara.

# Four Norbal Truths

Statements that cannot be false forever are referred to as "necessarily true" statements or "eternally true" statements. These are statements that are true in all possible circumstances or conditions and cannot be false under any circumstances.

There are four eternally trues that exists which are called four norbal truths and main target of the buddhism is realize these four thruths and he who realized these 4 truths completely is the one who achived Nirvan (enlightment).
So the person wanted to realize it he has to start his journey with simple understanding these truth and with the belief of Buddhas words and he has to go in the path step by step as Buddha has prescribed and person who follows will realize each of these truths instead of simple understanding of them.
